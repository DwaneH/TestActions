# GitHub - Learning Actions

Welcome to the GitHub Actions Learning Repo! This repository is designed to help you understand and practice GitHub Actions.  
Below are some of the key files and folders included:

- **learning/**: This folder contains the GitHub Actions learning documentation in markdown format.
- **images/**: This folder contains pictures for the learning documentation.
- **src/**: This folder contains some code files that wioll be used against the GitHub Actions.
- **.github/**: This folder is specific for GitHub templates.

The recommended route is to go through the learning documentation step by step.  
Feel free to modify the way you layout your workflows as you progress through the tasks.

If you don't have the basics of git (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git checkout`) I recommened going through the Git and GitHub learning resources below first!
